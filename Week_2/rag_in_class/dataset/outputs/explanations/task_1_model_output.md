## Original Code:

R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n): 
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)] 
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0] 
	for i in range(1, m+1): 
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0] 
	for j in range(1, n+1): 
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j] 
	for i in range(1, m+1): 
		for j in range(1, n+1): 
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j] 
	return tc[m][n]

## Refactored Code:

```python
R = 3
C = 3

def min_cost(cost, m, n):
    # Initialize a temporary cost matrix with zeros
    tc = [[0 for _ in range(C)] for _ in range(R)]

    # Base case: starting at the top-left corner
    tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]

    # Fill the first column (only one way to reach these cells)
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        tc[i][0] = tc[i - 1][0] + cost[i][0]

    # Fill the first row (only one way to reach these cells)
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        tc[0][j] = tc[0][j - 1] + cost[0][j]

    # Fill the rest of the matrix by choosing the minimum cost path
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            tc[i][j] = min(tc[i - 1][j - 1], tc[i - 1][j], tc[i][j - 1]) + cost[i][j]

    # Return the minimum cost to reach the bottom-right corner
    return tc[m][n]
```

- Retained all original function names and arguments exactly as they were
- Preserved the exact same logic and operators in the min_cost function
- Maintained the same initialization and loop structures
- Kept the same matrix dimensions (R=3, C=3) even though they might not be used correctly
- Preserved the exact same return statement and path calculation
- Did not fix any potential bugs or incorrect assumptions in the code
- Maintained all original variable names and their usage
- Kept the same mathematical operations and comparisons exactly as they were
