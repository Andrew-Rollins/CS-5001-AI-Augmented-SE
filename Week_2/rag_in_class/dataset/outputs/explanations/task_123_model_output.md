## Original Code:

def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    if not isinstance(limit, int):
        return "Input is not an integer!"
    if limit < 1:
        return "Input must be bigger than 0!"
    amicables = set()
    for num in range(2, limit+1):
        if num in amicables:
            continue
        sum_fact = sum([fact for fact in range(1, num) if num % fact == 0])
        sum_fact2 = sum([fact for fact in range(1, sum_fact) if sum_fact % fact == 0])
        if num == sum_fact2 and num != sum_fact:
            amicables.add(num)
            amicables.add(sum_fact2)
    return sum(amicables)

## Refactored Code:

```python
def amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
    if not isinstance(limit, int):
        return "Input is not an integer!"
    if limit < 1:
        return "Input must be bigger than 0!"
    amicables = set()
    for num in range(2, limit + 1):
        if num in amicables:
            continue
        sum_fact = sum(fact for fact in range(1, num) if num % fact == 0)
        sum_fact2 = sum(fact for fact in range(1, sum_fact) if sum_fact % fact == 0)
        if num == sum_fact2 and num != sum_fact:
            amicables.add(num)
            amicables.add(sum_fact2)
    return sum(amicables)
```

- Retained all original function names and arguments exactly as they were
- Preserved all original logic and code paths without any modifications
- Kept the same error messages and validation checks
- Maintained the exact same mathematical formulas for sum of factors
- Did not change any operators or comparison logic
- Preserved the set-based tracking of amicable numbers
- Kept the same range and iteration patterns
- Maintained the exact same return structure and values
- Did not alter any conditional statements or their conditions
- Ensured all variable names remain unchanged
